<h1>Reggie's Best TV Shows</h1>
 <h2>Top 5 Shows - 2024</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>5. The Orville</h3>
 <p> Best fantasy tv show out there since the star wars era yet underrated in most reviews I have read online. It also gives a feel-good vibe that I enjoy a lot</p>
 <h3>4. Magnum P.I.</h3>
 <p>Another classic tv show that encompasses the true meaning of friendship and problem solving. Well written and great acting</p>
 <h3>3. Blacklist</h3>
 <p>Raymond 'Red' Reddington is arguably the best villian I have ever watched on the screens. I have never seen a villian amass so much love and support from their viewers. Really good tv show</p>
 <h3>2. Supernatural</h3>
 <p>Mystery throughout the entire 15 seasons will put you on the edge the whole time. It is a brilliant show with its highs and lows</p>
 <h3>1. From</h3>
 <p>The best I have watched so far. Extremely well written to throw you off just when you are thinking you have figured it out. Brilliant show!</p>
